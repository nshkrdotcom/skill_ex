# SkillEx 2025.10 Future Direction

SkillEx has proven that a single packaging pipeline can keep Claude skills synchronized across a constellation of engineering teams. The next phase elevates SkillEx from a packaging utility into an intelligent operations hub that observes new skills, scores their quality, and continuously republishes production-ready bundles.

The roadmap below captures the foundational bets we want to make before the end of 2025 along with the milestones, dependencies, and risks we need to manage.

---

## Strategic Pillars

1. **Operational Intelligence**  
   - Provide near-real-time dashboards of skill ingestion activity, validation results, and packaging throughput.  
   - Layer in anomaly detection (submission spikes, validator regressions) using `:telemetry` events and the ExCoveralls API for data capture.

2. **Quality Gate Automation**  
   - Introduce a scoring pipeline that combines static analysis, test coverage, and validator lint results.  
   - Block packaging when a skill’s score drops below a configurable threshold and surface remediation notes via GitHub Checks.

3. **Publisher Experience**  
   - Offer a guided CLI (`mix skill_ex.init`) that bootstraps manifest entries, validator scripts, and CI snippets per repository.  
   - Ship a HexDocs cookbook with end-to-end examples and screencasts (`docs/cookbook/*.md`).

4. **Distribution Flexibility**  
   - Publish an S3/Cloudflare R2 backend so SkillEx can optionally mirror bundles and manifest metadata outside of git.  
   - Add delta updates where consumers can fetch only modified skills rather than the entire pack.

## Milestone Timeline

| Quarter | Focus | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Q4 2025** | Observability foundation | Emit `SkillEx.Aggregator` telemetry events, ship Grafana dashboards, instrument CLI logs with structured metadata. |
| **Q1 2026** | Quality scoring | Create `SkillEx.Scorecard`, integrate Credo/Dialyzer reports, add manifest field for score history. |
| **Q2 2026** | Publisher experience | Release `mix skill_ex.init`, deliver interactive README wizard, publish updated docs site with migration guides. |
| **Q3 2026** | Distribution | Implement delta packaging (`dist/deltas/`), add storage adaptors, document consumption patterns. |

Deliverables stay flexible to accommodate partner requests, but every quarter should close with a shippable artifact (Mix task, Doc update, or API contract) deployed to the main branch.

## Architecture Additions

- **Telemetry Bus**  
  Expand `SkillEx.Aggregator` to broadcast `:started`, `:validated`, `:packaged`, and `:failed` events. Expose a `SkillEx.Telemetry.attach_default/0` helper so consumers can wire dashboards with minimal effort.

- **Scorecard Service**  
  Introduce a `SkillEx.Scorecard` module responsible for combining test coverage, validator output, and static analysis results into weighted scores. Persist results in `manifest.json` to track history and trigger alerts when scores regress.

- **Delta Packager**  
  Create a new behaviour (`SkillEx.Packager`) with default implementations for full and delta bundles. Skill consumers can choose strategies in the manifest (e.g., `"packager": "delta"`).

---

## Collaboration & Ecosystem

- Partner with the GeminiEx and ALTAR teams to share validation rules and telemetry schemas, ensuring consistency for multi-repo deployments.
- Offer API hooks (`SkillEx.Webhooks`) so downstream systems (Slack bots, deployment gates) can react when new skills are published or rejected.
- Establish a public roadmap page on HexDocs and solicit community feedback via GitHub Discussions.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overlapping telemetry standards with partner repos | Conflicting dashboards and noisy alerts | Define a shared `SkillEx.Event` schema and publish it as part of the HexDocs API reference. |
| Scorecard false positives halting releases | Deployment delays | Allow override approvals by maintainers and ship a CLI command to re-score locally (`mix skill_ex.score --approve`). |
| Storage adaptor complexity | Longer release cycles | Start with a pluggable behaviour and ship S3 as the reference implementation before expanding to other backends. |

---

## Call to Action

- Draft RFCs for telemetry events and scoring formulas by **2025-11-15**.
- Identify design partners willing to pilot delta packaging and external storage sync in **Q1 2026**.
- Prioritize documentation debt—ensure every new feature lands with recipes, architecture notes, and CLI walkthroughs.

SkillEx evolves when we blend automation with clarity. This document is the north star: iterate on it as we learn, measure, and scale.
